{"name":"Ulib","tagline":"C++ application development framework, to help developers create and deploy applications very fast and more simple","body":"# ULib - C++ library\r\n\r\nTravis CI: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stefanocasazza/ULib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stefanocasazza/ULib)\r\nCoverity Scan: [![Coverity Scan Build Status](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/3322/badge.svg)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/3322)\r\n\r\nULib is a highly optimized class framework for writing C++ applications. I wrote this framework as my tool for writing applications in various contexts. It is a result of many years of work as C++ programmer. I think, in my opinion, that its strongest points are simplicity, efficiency and sophisticate debugging.\r\n\r\nULib is meant as a very light-weight C++ library to facilitate using C++ design patterns even for very deeply embedded applications, such as for systems using uclibc along with posix threading support. For this reason, ULib disables language features that consume memory or introduce runtime overhead, such as rtti and exception handling, and assumes one will mostly be linking applications with other pure C based libraries rather than using the overhead of the standard C++ library and other similar class frameworks.\r\n\r\nIt include as application example a powerful search engine with relative [web interface](https://github.com/stefanocasazza/ULib/blob/master/examples/IR/ir_web.usp) and a multi purpose server (plugin oriented) which results, out of [John Fremlin accurate investigations](http://john.freml.in/ulib-fast-io-framework), to be one of the fastest web application frameworks for serving small dynamic webpages (and also make easier the usage of shell scripts for CGI application)\r\n\r\n# userver (`_tcp` | `_ssl` | `_ipc`) application server (`plugin oriented`)\r\n\r\nThe current version offers the following features :\r\n\r\n   * HTTP/1.0 and 1.1 protocols supported.\r\n   * Persistent connections for HTTP/1.1 and Keep-Alive support for HTTP/1.0.\r\n   * Browser cache management (headers: If-Modified-Since/Last-modified).\r\n   * Chunk-encoding transfers support.\r\n   * HTTP multi-range request support.\r\n   * Memory caching of document root for (small) static pages with smart gzip compression and CSS/JS reduction.\r\n   * Support for automatic update of caching document root with inotify (on Linux).\r\n   * Support for pipelining.\r\n   * Support for virtual hosts (also with SSL).\r\n   * Support for basic/digest authentication.\r\n   * Support for directory listings via basic/digest authentication.\r\n   * Support for uri protection.\r\n   * Support for aliases/redirection.\r\n   * Support for switch the site to a maintenance page only.\r\n   * Support for overriden of error messages by local document (ErrorDocument/40x|500.html).\r\n   * Support for RewriteRule (lighttpd-like) that check for file existence as they do on Apache, some CMS (SilverStripe) require it.\r\n   * Support for (apache-like) log [NCSA extended/combined format](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_log_config.html)\r\n   * Support for [JSONRequest](http://json.org/JSONRequest.html).\r\n   * Accept HTTP uploads up to 4 GB without increasing memory usage.\r\n   * Support for upload progress via USP (ULib Servlet Page).\r\n   * General [CGI](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) support (run any CGI script) with automatic output compression (using gzip method).\r\n   * CGI support for shell script processes (with automatic management of form and cookie).\r\n   * CGI support for the X-Sendfile feature and also supports X-Accel-Redirect headers transparently.\r\n   * Support for minify HTML CGI output with wrapping [google page speed SDK](http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/download.html#pagespeed-sdk).\r\n   * Support for running JavaScript code with wrapping [google V8 JavaScript Engine](http://code.google.com/apis/v8/intro.html).\r\n   * [HTTP pseudo-streaming](http://www.phpmotionwiz.com/what-is-pseudo-streaming) for FLV video managed transparently.\r\n   * [C Servlet Support](http://bellard.org/tcc/) with libtcc (if available) as a backend for dynamic code generation (experimental).\r\n   * Preforking mode to improve concurrency.\r\n   * Support for Windows (without preforking).\r\n   * Customizable builds (you can remove unneeded functionality).\r\n   * Requests cut in phases for modular architecture (apache-like).\r\n   * Configuration file with dedicated section.\r\n   * Built-in modules :\r\n       * `mod_echo` : echo features.\r\n       * `mod_rpc` : generic Remote Procedure Call.\r\n       * `mod_http` : core features, static file handler and dynamic page (ULib Servlet Page).\r\n       * `mod_ssi` : [Server Side Includes]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Include) support with enhanced #set, direct include and #exec servlet (C/ULib Servlet Page).\r\n       * `mod_nocat` : [captive portal](http://nocat.net/) implementation.\r\n       * `mod_proxy` : multi-features reverse proxy with websocket support.\r\n       *
